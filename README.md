In this project, I used multiple types of frontend development, including basic HTML and JavaScript with Express and a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular. HTML and JavaScript on the Express side were used primarily to serve static files and display simple web content. The SPA built with Angular offers a more advanced user experience, allowing for fast navigation between views without page reloads. The SPA architecture makes the application feel seamless by managing the interface state on the client side, whereas traditional Express-based development relies on multiple server calls to load new pages.

*Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?*

MongoDB was chosen as the backend database because it handles unstructured data efficiently. As a NoSQL database, it stores data in JSON-like documents, which aligns well with the structure of JavaScript objects used throughout the frontend. MongoDB also supports scalable and flexible data schemas, which is useful for evolving applications, like the one I built, that need to handle various data types without rigid schemas.

*How is JSON different from JavaScript, and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?*

JavaScript is a programming language that adds logic and interactivity to web pages, and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used to transmit data between the frontend and backend. JSON is language-independent and acts as a bridge in full stack applications, allowing the backend to send data to the frontend in a structured format that the frontend can easily parse and display. In this project, JSON responses were used to transfer data, such as user inputs or records, between the Angular frontend and Express backend through API endpoints.

*Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.*

A few examples of refactoring to improve functionality and efficiency include optimizing the Angular frontend by creating reusable components, such as the edit and add trip forms, and replacing static HTML pages with Handlebars templates. This approach allowed me to reuse the same page structure while dynamically changing the displayed content. By reusing these UI components, I improved maintainability, reduced code duplication, and made it easier to manage updates across the application. Additionally, I refactored the code by replacing hardcoded API routes with modular services in Angular, which improved code organization and made testing more straightforward. These refactors streamlined data flow throughout the app, resulting in better performance and greater scalability.

*Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.*

In this project, I used GET and PUT methods to retrieve and update data between the frontend and backend through Express API endpoints. Each endpoint was tested using tools like Postman to ensure that the frontend was receiving the correct data and that updates were being saved in the MongoDB database. Securing the endpoints was critical to prevent unauthorized access, especially for operations that modify data. This required implementing authentication and testing protected routes to verify that only authorized users could access them. Testing API endpoints with added security layers involved validating both functionality and security, ensuring that correct HTTP status codes (like 401 Unauthorized) were returned when needed.

*How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?*

This course has been instrumental in helping me achieve my professional goals by giving me hands-on experience in full stack development. Iâ€™ve developed skills in frontend frameworks like Angular, backend development with Express, and database management with MongoDB. I also gained a deeper understanding of how to integrate the frontend and backend, manage APIs, and secure web applications. Mastering these skills has improved my ability to build complex applications from scratch and made me a more competitive candidate in the software development field. Additionally, working on real-world scenarios, like refactoring code and testing secure endpoints, has prepared me to handle similar challenges in a professional environment.
